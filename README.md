# VLC-GPO-Startup-Installation
Lightweight Installation/Update/Downgrade script to deploy VLC Media Player interactively or by a startup script (e.g. using a GPO)

Adjust the parameter section in the script to your specific needs

You would be mad to use this script since there is a msi installer available now at [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html)
